Since March, the number of viewers to our site has increased seven-fold (to as many as 20,000 per day and more) and we are investing our resources accordingly. In fact, we have so many concrete ideas to put the site to new innovative uses, that our one full-time Web Developer has much more work to do than he can possibly handle. Among the new uses we are developing are:</p>\n<p>Conducting secret ballot ratification votes online;\nProviding multi-lingual content to an incredibly diverse membership (the current site supports English, Spanish and Chinese content);\nMobilizing rank-and-file political action in a private individually personalized Member Section;\nProviding non-union workers with a confidential communication channel with the union and interactive pages allowing them to compare their wages, benefits and working conditions to those enjoyed by unionized workers; and\nMany other applications.</p>\n<p>Our Union constantly seeks new ways to increase our effectiveness through smart use of technology and we are looking for a creative developer to help conceive of, design and implement tools to support the Union in our mission.</p>\n<p>This position offers the prospect of a great career and, as we are a labor union, an excellent benefit package.</p>\n<p>The team currently works remotely from home due to the COVID situation. When things return to normal, we intend to be flexible about remote work, and will consider skilled applicants who don’t live in the New York area.</p>\n<p>Starting salary: $70,000 to $85,000</p>\n<p>Benefits include: Medical, Dental, Optical, and Prescription Drugs with family coverage (including domestic partners); Pension, Pre-paid Legal, Flexible Spending Accounts, Life Cycle Benefits, Long-Term Care Insurance, and other benefits.</p>\n<p>Requirements:\nAt least 3 years developing websites using an MVC framework (with preference given to specific knowledge of Laravel PHP framework).\nStrong UI/UX design skills\nStrong javascript skills</p>\n<p>Other useful experience/qualifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advanced experience managing SQL databases</li>\n<li>Linux server administration</li>\n<li>Networking skills</li>\n<li>Python</li>\n</ul>\n",
